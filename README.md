# Netflix - IMDB
A Tampermonkey script to show IMDB ratings on Netflix. 

It adds IMDB ratings to the title overlay, title details, similar titles and main trailer. Take a look to the attached screenshots. 

Originally developed by [ioannisioannou16](github.com/ioannisioannou16)

Modified to account for Netflix UI changes

## Installation 
1) Install [tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) extension
2) Install [script](https://github.com/kraki5525/netflix-imdb/raw/master/netflix-imdb.user.js) 
## Limitation
Currently the script only uses the title name to get the imdb rating, so in case of multiple imdb matches, it may link to the wrong title.
